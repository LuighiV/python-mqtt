### The Examples
In __generic__ are 4 Paho MQTT examples that can be easily modified to work with a generic MQTT broker. _paho_pub.py_ and _paho_sub.py_ are straight forward examples of publishing and subscribing with Paho MQTT. _paho_key_ publishes input taken from the keyboard, and _paho_ser.py_ publishes input taken from the serial port.

In __aws__ are skeletons for talking MQTT to AWS IoT. They are straightforward examples and should be easily adapted for your needs. To talk to AWS IoT over MQTT you first need to get your device configured in the AWS IoT Core and set up certs. See links above for how to do this.

In __azure__ are skeletons for talking to Azure IoT Hub. They are straightforward examples and should be easily adapted for your needs. These skeletons are set up to talk to Azure IoT Hub using x509 certificates and will need to be modified if you wish to use SAS tokens. To talk to Azure IoT over MQTT you first need to get your device configured in the Azure IoT Hub and set up certs. See links above for how to do this.


-------------------
### Run on a Device
After editing the files to work with your MQTT broker put, your target Python file, any needed cert or key files, and _paho.zip_ onto the device. (_paho.zip_ is simply a _paho/_ zipped) Remember to respect the device's 8.3 file format and flat file system. Add _paho.zip_ to the device's Python path and run your target file with `python file.py`.

The target file can also be run locally with Python2.

-------------------
### Running in local deployment
It is useful being able to test the library via a local deployment so you may
have the necessity to install this library in the local setup. For this, a
slightly different 
`setup.py` file from original repository is being employed.

To get the original file you could perfom the following command:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python/master/setup.py -o setup.py
```

Don't forget that, to install the library you should use:
```
python setup.py install
```

#### Testing with no-ssl
To test the library without ssl, there is an example under `/generic/no-ssl`
which uses a local deployment or a public broker at eclipse.

#### Testing with Thingsboard
You could use the following commands to launch a docker container with basic
Thingsboard features:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.mytb-data && sudo chown -R 799:799 ~/.mytb-data
mkdir -p ~/.mytb-logs && sudo chown -R 799:799 ~/.mytb-logs
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -p 1883:1883 -p 5683:5683/udp -v ~/.mytb-data:/data \
-v ~/.mytb-logs:/var/log/thingsboard --name mytb --restart always thingsboard/tb-postgres
```
Then you could use the test files located in the `thingsboard` folder.

### Paho
__The Paho library in this directory has been modified__. The standard Paho library does not run on the Python implementation that ships with these devices. The standard Paho library as well as its documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python).

This Python implementation does not include support for non blocking sockets which are relied on by Paho for threading. So Paho's thread support has been removed.

This Python implementation has an older version of Python's SSL library that does not include _SSLContext_. `ssl.wrap_socket()` is called directly instead. However, the _cipher_ argument for `ssl.wrap_socket()` is not included.

This Python implementation's SSL library does not have `ssl.match_hostname`, so Paho's `client.tls_set_insecure` method has been removed.

This modified Paho library has not been extensively tested.
